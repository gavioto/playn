Here we document our future development plans and provide a place to keep track of feature
requests.

See the [PlatformStatus](PlatformStatus.md) for the completeness of the implementation on each of the supported
platforms.

## Roadmap ##

  * WebSocket support for all backends (currently only on Java and HTML)

## Wish list ##

  * Accelerometer support
  * Better documentation
  * Keyframe animation support (external library)  (see https://github.com/threerings/flump and https://github.com/threerings/tripleplay/tree/master/core/src/main/java/tripleplay/flump)
  * Bitmap font support (external library)
  * Windows Phone 7 backend
  * XBLA/XNA backend
  * Raw socket I/O for all backends except HTML5
